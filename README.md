🐦 Flappy Bird AI

A reinforcement learning-based AI that learns to play Flappy Bird using Python and NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies). 🧠🤖

✨ Features

🚀 Uses NEAT to evolve neural networks for playing Flappy Bird.

🎮 Implements Pygame for game rendering.

📈 Trains multiple generations of AI agents to improve performance.

👀 Visualizes the learning process in real-time.

⚙️ Installation

Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies:

pip install pygame neat-python

▶️ How to Run

Clone the repository and execute the main script:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flappybird-ai.git
cd flappybird-ai
python main.py

🛠 How It Works

Game Environment: 🎮 Built using Pygame to simulate Flappy Bird.

NEAT Algorithm: 🧠 Evolves a neural network to learn how to play the game.

Fitness Function: 🏆 AI is rewarded for surviving longer and passing obstacles.

Training Process: 🔁 Over multiple generations, the AI improves its gameplay.

⚙️ Configuration

The config-feedforward.txt file contains NEAT settings. Adjust parameters such as population size and mutation rates to fine-tune training.
